If you sometimes need to check the meaning of a word in your graph, this extension will allow you to do it.

Simply select a word by double-clicking or shift-dragging over it. Then, use the keyboard shortcut ALT-SHIFT-d.

The extension will get the definition(s) available and create a words/definitions/_word_ page for you, then open it in the right sidebar. The original word will become a blockref to the word definition so you can easily check it again later if you're prone to forget.

You need an API key from https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi to make this extension work. You can make up to 2500 requests each day on the free tier, so you will be unlikely to require a paid account.
